				<h2>What is Paintless Dent Repair?</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/paintless-dent-repair/">Paintless Dent Repair (PDR)</a> is the insurance-preferred method of repairing automotive hail damage.  Intellident specializes in this type of repair!</p>
				<p>Can we fix damage that is not hail related? Sure, but it depends on what it is. Door dings or other small dents that have not damaged the paint are also appropriate jobs for PDR, but our primary focus is hail damage that is covered through a comprehensive claim through insurance. This also includes fleets of commercial vehicles that need hail damage repairs done.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Why choose paintless dent repair over the traditional dent removal methods of auto repair shops?</h2>
				<p>The paintless dent repair process uses a series of specialized tools that massage the dents out of the car from the inside or opposite side of the indentation.</p>
				<p>By using this method, there is no need to do any filler, sanding, or alternate paint to repaint the car.  Repainting the car will not only void the original warranty but also decreases resale value.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Why use Paintless Dent Repair?</h2>
				<p>If the above reasons aren’t enough to convince you, check out our blog post titled <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/blog/2018/05/11/benefits-of-paintless-dent-repair/">5 Surprising Benefits of Paintless Dent Repair.</a></p>
				<p>IntelliDent makes the PDR process even easier by offering <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/lifetime-warranty/">limited lifetime warranties</a> on all repaired vehicles, <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/valet-services/">seamless valet service</a> to/from your office or home, as well as a <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/pay-no-deductible-auto-hail-repair/">pay-no-deductible guarantee.</a></p>
				<br>
				<h2>How much does Paintless Dent Repair cost?</h2>
				<p>Because of the frequency with this question, we have put together an <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/auto-hail-repair/">Auto Hail Damage</a> cost estimation tool.  You can visit that tool <a href="https://www.intellidentpdr.com/blog/2018/07/09/paintless-dent-repair-pdr-estimation-calculator/">here</a>.</p>
				<p>The only good thing about auto hail damage is that most often there is no cost associated with the repair.  How does that happen?  Hail storms cannot be considered to be a fault by you.  When Mother Nature decides to dump hail all over your new car, there is nothing you can do about it.  Garages and overpasses are a great reprieve, but not always available when you need them.</p>
				<p>Most auto insurance companies will cover the cost to repair the damage, save a deductible.  With IntelliDent, we will help you out even more by covering your deductible!</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Will dents come back after Paintless Dent Repair?</h2>
				<p>Dents will not come back once it has been removed with Paintless Dent Repair.  As long as the dent has been removed properly (not over-extended or paint chipping), there is no way you will ever see that dent again.</p>
				<p>Even if your vehicle was <strong>covered</strong> with dents caused by hail damage, this is still the case!</p>
				<br>
				<h2>**Damage we cannot fix:</h2>
				<p>-Motorcycle gas tanks</p>
				<p>-Bumpers (plastic does not bend back like metal does)</p>
				<p>-Campers or RVs</p>
				<p>-Cars that are over 12 years old – the paint does not flex like new paint does, so sometimes PDR can crack out older, more brittle paint.</p>
				<br>
